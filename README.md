# Face-Detection-Model
This custom face detection model is built on the VGG16 convolutional neural network, which is a widely used deep learning architecture known for its high accuracy and versatility. By leveraging VGG16, i was able to create a highly accurate model that can quickly and reliably detect faces in a wide range of images and videos.

To train my model, i utilized a combination of data augmentation and custom datasets. This involved using techniques such as image flipping, rotation, and scaling to artificially expand the dataset, making it more diverse and less prone to overfitting. We also curated a custom dataset of labeled images of faces, including a variety of facial expressions, poses, and lighting conditions, to ensure that our model was capable of detecting faces in a range of scenarios.

One of the key features of this custom face detection model is the use of custom image labeling. This involved manually labeling each image in the dataset with the location and size of the face in the image. By providing the model with this highly precise labeling information,i was able to train it to accurately detect faces even in scenarios where the face is partially occluded or located in a challenging location within the image.

Overall, the custom face detection model represents a significant advance in the field of computer vision and has the potential to be applied in a wide range of applications, from facial recognition to security systems to social media photo tagging.
